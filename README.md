# Simon_JS
A simple 'Simon' game that I created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

For this project, I started with a simple boilerplate for the HTML and CSS and had to build the functionality using JavaScript. I implemented jQuery as it is a popular framework and reduces the code dramatically.

Overall, I found the project uncomfortable but this pushed me to use my knowledge and also the documentation to ensure I completed all the relevant steps. When I revisit this project, I potentially will add the user score at the end so they can see what level they got up to.
